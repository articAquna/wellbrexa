leve l : promting the user ( worker ) about personal information 
information includes name age family workproffesion etc( if you want to include what thing we should ask him do edit  ) 
after clearifing  work proffesion of the person  we will narrow down  our approch to specific question

questions will be modeled from a prerecorded array in specific sequece 
string arrays will move inrespect to there int array in sequntial order

user only has to validaty in yes or no to the question proposed as true or false 
to each question he chooses true its respected array (positive / negative) int array ,value at that point will be if true remain same if fasle become zero

pogram records user data by storing them in arrays under the tag of his name and a specific number sequece  


after the final question through a generic formulae we will traslate the net effect of the (positive and the negative)arrays  value inrespect to the other  and then conclude ..........
