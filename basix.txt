code draft is as following 

promting the user ( worker ) about personal information 
information includes name age family workproffesion etc( edit here ) 
after clearifing the type of work proffesion we will narrow down on our approch to specific question
there be 2  each question array will be of data type string  , negivequestion array and positive quesion array each will have anohter array incorealtion with them negative one will have array of negative int 
and positive one array of positive int
questions will be modeled from a prerecorded array in specific sequece
to the same question array will have a array which will assign value to the specific question in data type int 
arrays will move inrespect to each other in haroney

user only has to validaty in yes or no where the question proposed are true or false 
to each question he chooses true its respected array (positive / negative) int array ,value at that point will be if true remain same if fasle become zero

pogram records user data by storing them in arrays  


after the final question through a generic formulae we will traslate the net effect of the (positive and the negative)arrays  value inrespect to the other  and then conclude ..........
